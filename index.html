                <p>
                    My name is Tyler, and I reside in a small town outside of Boston, MA.
                    The charms of this town are numerable. To give it a shot:

                    <ol>
                        <li>It's quite pretty</li>
                    </ol>

                <h3>Web Development</h3>
                <p>Web development is something I've found my way to recently,
                    but I appreciate the challenges it poses, 
                    and the creative freedom it allows.

                <h3>Other Interests</h3>
                <p>Outside of web development, my interests vary between:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>fashion</li>
                        <li>film</li>
                        <li>experimental and ambient music</li>
                        <li>and frequent flights of fancy.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    I'm a hopeless romantic, with the emphasis on <em>"hopeless,"</em>
                    and I aim to make enough money that my cat can live comfortably.

                    Until I have a professional headshot, and a more professional site,
                    here is a picture of my cat, who is far more photogenic than I am anyway.

                <p>    
                    His name is Tetra.
